    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a simple but delicious recipe for Kulfi (Indian Ice Cream) that I got from my sister-in-law.    </p>
    <p>
        I have made this several times, and it always gets rave reviews - even the kids love it! For extra flavor, you could add a few drops of rose water or ground pistachios.    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
        <li>4 slices white bread, torn into pieces</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            Combine evaporated milk, condensed milk and whipped topping in a blender and blend in pieces of bread until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish or two plastic ice cube trays, sprinkle with cardamom and freeze for 8 hours or overnight. 
        </li>
    </ol>
