    <img src="../images/murghkari.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken curry is a dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is common in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Great Britain, Caribbean, and Japan. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A typical curry from the Indian subcontinent consists of chicken stewed in an onion- and tomato-based sauce, flavoured with ginger, garlic, tomato puree, chilli peppers and a variety of spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and cardamom. Outside of South Asia, chicken curry is often made with a pre-made spice mixture known as curry powder.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Garam masala</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>
        <li>Turmeric</li>
        <li>Cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Boneless chicken breasts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside. </li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring. </li>
        <li>Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the mixture; stir to combine. </li>
        <li>Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken. </li>
        <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to serve. </li>
    </ol>
